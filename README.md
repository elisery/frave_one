# Frave-One - Rails API for Frave: Goal Oriented Saving

<img src="app/assets/images/Main_image.png" width="200" />

Frave is a web application geared towards goal-oriented saving. Users create savings goals and add transactions to the goal to "pay it down". For example, the goal might be to save $1000 for a vacation. To add transactions (i.e. savings) to the goal, the user
will enter items and the amount they saved - if they saved $10.00 by using coupons, they can add this as a transaction towards the goal. 

When setting up a new goal, users set up customized rewards that they can redeem as they reach goal "milestones", i.e. 10% of the goal, 25% of the goal, etc.
